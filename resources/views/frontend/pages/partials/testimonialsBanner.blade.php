                        <h5>Scotch Treat</h5>
                        <p>Recently retired, visiting Scotch whiskey country we discovered this intimate retreat. The setting is beautiful in the bucolic Scottish countryside. The staff was attentive and accommodating. The food was outstanding. I highly recommend this one of a kind location experience.</p>

                            This place is a gem. We had a wonderful evening enjoying our own selfmade whiskey tasting. Very friendly staff and as far as we heard perfect food as well. If you stay or travel trough - don't miss the Mash Tun üëçüèª

                        <p>
                            Just on the side of the river is this gem, hidden away from the Main Street serving a 1st class evening meal & an even better breakfast, take a walk up to the main road, turn right & there‚Äôs Aberlour distillery, turn left for 10 minutes & you‚Äôve got Walkers biscuits, a great find.

                        <h5>Amazing place, centrally located in whisky country!</h5>
                        <p>
                            The staff and place is amazing. Food in restaurant (both breakfast and dinner) was excellent and the staff looked after everything we could imagine. British Airways lost our luggage and they even offered to do our laundry!!! We will definitely stay here again as we loved the experience! All staff were incredible, but Sharon the manager was so friendly and attentive.
